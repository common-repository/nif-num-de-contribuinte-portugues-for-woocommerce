== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to make the NIF field required? =

Classic checkout - Add this to your themeâ€™s functions.php file or code snippets plugin:

`add_filter( 'woocommerce_nif_field_required', '__return_true' );`

Blocks checkout - Activate the "Required" option on the NIF block.

= Is it possible to validate the check digit to ensure a valid Portuguese NIF/NIPC is entered by the customer? =

Yes, it is!

Classic checkout - Add this to your themeâ€™s functions.php file or code snippets plugin:

`add_filter( 'woocommerce_nif_field_validate', '__return_true' );`

Blocks checkout - Activate the "Validate" option on the NIF block.

We only recommend validating the NIF if your shop only sells to Portugal.

= How to change the NIF field position on the checkout? =

Classic checkout - Add this to your themeâ€™s functions.php file or code snippets plugin:

`add_filter( 'woocommerce_nif_field_priority', function( $priority) {
	// Default is 120 - Adjust the number to move the field up (lower number) or down (higher number)
	return 120;
} );`

Blocks checkout - For now, the block is fixed after the billing address and before the shipping options. Weâ€™re working on making it possible to move the block where you want.
Future instructions for the Block checkout - Move the NIF block up or down as wanted. We do not recommend moving this field above the billing and shipping addresses, as its visibility may depend on the chosen country.

= Is this plugin compliant with the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)? =

First of all, itâ€™s the website ownerâ€™s responsibility to make your whole website compliant because no personal details whatsoever are transmitted to us, the plugin developers.
Anyway, we can help you by documenting how this plugin handles the collected data:
* The NIF/NIPC field is collected via the checkout process and stored as an order meta value, alongside all the other WooCommerce order fields;
* The NIF/NIPC field can also be set on the "My Account - Billing Address" form and itâ€™s then stored as a user meta value, alongside all the other WordPress and WooCommerce user fields;
* The NIF/NIPC field is shown and editable on the order edit and user edit screens on the backend, by the store owner;
* The NIF/NIPC field is shown on the order transactional emails;
